\section{Introduction}

Idea: embed the deep learning agents of Mathy https://mathy.ai/api/models/ into a geographical space 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Do coevolution niche emerge?
    \item Do different regions discover ``different ways to do maths''?
    \item optimal modularity for global/local performance; rate of knowledge exchange between communities?
\end{itemize}

Close to ideas of biogeography evolutionary algorithms?

\cite{mirjalili2014let} trains deep neural networks with a biogeography algorithm. What are exchanged / mutated are part of each neural networks - populations are neurons. Not exactly similar to populations of neural networks? No heuristic process to justify migration of some neurons only.
